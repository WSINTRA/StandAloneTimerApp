# TimerApp

Problem - I needed a simple timer app for use in the classroom between activities.

## Solution
I created a vanilla JS electron app that can quickly create a countdown timer in minutes or seconds. 
You can clone this directory and use npm install,
Or There is a stand alone mac executable in dist.

Feel free to use it.
